## CLIENT CHALLENGES

Outdated target candidate profiling models did not reflect recent changes in hiring needs and talent supply.

Key challenge: *Uncertainty over existing recruitment and hiring methodology.*

In the intense competition for top talent, Deloitte HR executives were acutely aware of the shortcomings of their current recruitment processes.

> Profile screening → Online Test → Group Assessment → Partner Interview Offer

What were those shortcomings?
* Soft skills were difficult to detect
	* Standard online testing was time-consuming and inflexible
	* Structured tests were easy to manipulate
* Human bias was sabotaging candidate selection based on objective merit
* Turnaround time took too long, turning off top candidates

## OUR SOLUTION: SOFT SKILLS ANALYSIS FOR PREDICTION OF BEST-FIT TALENTS

(1) Seedlink combines machine learning, neuro-linguistic insight, and natural language processing to accurately detect soft skills.

(2) Our simpler evaluation process is easier to finish and more user-friendly compared to the standard online test, effectively broadening the candidate pool.

(3) Open-ended questions are harder to manipulate.

A total of 1800 candidates were evaluated evenly using both Seedlink’s solution and the company’s standard test. The top-ranking candidates from each of the two methods were then invited to participate in a formal group assessment. 
Among the applicants recommended by Seedlink, 58 received a job offer. Meanwhile, only 31 of those recommended by the standard online test were offered a job.
* The software predicted candidates’ performance and soft skills competencies with 87% greater accuracy than traditional methods
* Candidates’ assessment times were reduced ten-fold
